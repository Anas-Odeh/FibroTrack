# FibroTrack
## FibroTrack: A Standalone Deep Learning Platform for Accurate Fibrosis Quantification in Skeletal and Cardiac Muscle Tissues ##

FibroTrack is an innovative deep learning platform developed to automate the quantification of fibrosis in histological images of cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues. By leveraging advanced color space manipulation and state-of-the-art segmentation models, FibroTrack enables precise, reproducible, and high-throughput fibrosis analysis.

## Key Features ##
* Utilizes the LAB color space to accurately isolate fibrotic regions highlighted by Sirius Red, Immunohistochemistry and Masson's Trichrome stains.

* Incorporates the YOLOv11 deep learning model trained on a large, diverse dataset to reliably segment muscle tissues.

* Provides robust fibrosis ratio measurements to assess disease progression or treatment response in an objective, unbiased manner.

* Validated across staining protocols and tissue types to ensure consistent, generalizable performance.

* Offers a user-friendly interface and organized output for easy integration into research workflows in 3 distinct steps:

## Applications ##
FibroTrack has wide-ranging applications in preclinical and clinical studies where fibrosis quantification is essential, such as:

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy models, to assess progressive muscle tissue replacement by fibrosis.
Cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure models induced by pressure overload, to evaluate pathological cardiac remodeling.
Clinical samples, to correlate fibrosis levels with patient outcomes, prognosis, or response to therapies.
